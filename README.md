# CSIS 3375 – UX Design in Web and Mobile Applications
**Section:** 04 <br>
**Group Number:** 05 <br>
**Project Name:** BuildMate

## Project Description
BuildMate is a comprehensive mobile application prototype designed to make the PC building experience accessible to everyone. It bridges the gap between novice users and complex hardware assembly through intuitive, visual-first tools.

**Key Features:**
* **My Builds:** Manage your saved PC configurations and easily start creating new custom builds from scratch.
* **Benchmarks:** Visualize system performance data, compare metrics between different builds, and run simulations to test efficiency.
* **Community Hub:** Browse trending posts, view other users' builds, and engage with the community to share experiences and questions.
* **Part Picker Wizard:** A beginner-friendly tool that automatically recommends compatible components based on your specific budget and usage needs.
* **Simulation:** Learn the physical assembly process through an interactive, step-by-step 3D guide designed to reduce anxiety for first-time builders.
